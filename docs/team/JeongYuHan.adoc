== Introduction and Overview

The purpose of this document is to display the author's (Jeong Yu Han) contribution to the software engineering project and his technical skills.

My team and I were tasked with enhancing a command line interface Address Book application for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it into a teaching assistant called the Njoy Teaching Assistant, targeted at tech-savvy teachers who wish to improve
the efficiency of their daily tasks such as keeping schedules, creating quizzes, keeping track of student performances and keeping timely reminders.


This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write code for the notes and statistics features. The rest of the sections will cover the
summary of my contributions to the codebase, the user guide and the developer guide on how I implemented the features.

The following are icons and symbols that I will be using for the Project Portfolio:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates a note to the user.

[TIP]
This symbol indicates a user friendly tip.

[IMPORTANT]
This symbol indicates something important.

`This indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.`

*This indicates important text.*

== Summary of contributions

This section details a summary of my specific enhancements, code contributions and other helpful increments towards making the Njoy Teaching Assistant.

I implemented the notes specific commands which include:

* *Creating a note*
* *Editing a note*
* *Deleting a note*
* *Listing the notes*
* *Sorting the notes by priority*

[[Grouping]]
I'll be sectioning the functionality into the following format:

. *Creating*
. *Editing*
. *Displaying*
. *Sorting/Processing*

=== Enhancements

==== Creating Notes

* *What it does:* Users can create notes with a title and description. Should the user please, the user is able to assign
a priority to the note when creating it. Adding a note will append it to the bottom of the list, and is shown in the User Interface
according to its priority. The default priority is unmarked, which has grey panels, while the high, medium and low priority notes
are red, yellow and green respectively.

* *Justification:* Teachers often have a dizzying array of tasks to handle. Apart from taking care of their family, they still
have to attend to the students, their departmental heads et cetera. They often use applications such as Sticky Notes or Google Calendar to keep track
of all their tasks. The notes feature separates the work and home worries that every teacher has to deal with. Teachers also want to be able
to look at the most pressing issues at one glance, for nobody wants to miss an important conference.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was required serious contemplation in terms of design considerations. While the implementation of additional features such as
re-doing, un-doing was considered, I decided that the main UX principle of the notes feature was that it was supposed to be super
lightweight and easy to use. I decided to give the simplest set of commands for this feature while making prioritising on optional utility.

==== Editing Notes

* *What it does:* Users can choose to edit their notes after creation. The user can do so by specifying the index of the note it is displayed in
in the current list shown. He then gives fields to edit, such as the note title, description or priority.

* *Justification:* Users often make mistakes while typing. Teachers often suddenly see shifts in priority as important school events
arise, and the flexibility to edit a targeted note or reminder is important.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was relatively challenging because of the validation issues. Given any number of optional fields that the user can specify to edit,
the feature had to ensure that the edit command was valid - that it maintained the unique property of the note, that there was at least one editable
property specified and that the new note was different from the original one.

==== Displaying Notes

* *What it does:* Shows the list of notes in the command result box. This feature is an alternative solution to the issue of notes having variable length - the notes
can have content that exceed its allocated space in the User Interface.

* *Justification:* A teacher might want to keep notes that are quite long but do not fit into its allocated space. This is due to the fact that
the notes appear as a panel on the side, leaving space for other features such as the timetable. Should the content be truncated in Njoy, the user
can opt for this listing feature to see its full content in the command box.

* *Highlights:* This enhancement works with existing as well as future commands. The implementation for this
feature was not difficult but required some consideration about the user's experience.
