== Introduction
Njoy is a teacher assistant designed to manage teacher's daily tasks such as generating
quizzes, managing classes and viewing grades reports.

Shown below is the GUI of Njoy Teaching Assistant:

image::Ui.png[]

This documentation serves as an introduction to the architecture and implementation of Njoy,
and is made for developers who wish to maintain, modify or understand the software development
behind our application. We adopted the top-down approach; we will first look into high-level architectures
before exploring implementation details of each feature.

We encourage you to traverse the full path from the high level design to the implementation details
of the feature you are interested for the most complete understanding.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Njoy's Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Njoy.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Question feature

The question feature utilises the `QuestionCommandParser` class to parse the user command input into the different
command types and validates the input. There are two types of questions `OpenEndedQuestion` and `McqQuestion` which
extends the `Question` class. Questions are then added into the `QuestionBank#questions` observable list. +

The feature comprises of five commands namely,

* <<Feature-Question-Add, `QuestionAddCommand`>> - Adding questions
* <<Feature-Question-Edit, `QuestionEditCommand`>> - Editing questions
* <<Feature-Question-Delete, `QuestionDeleteCommand`>> - Deleting questions
* <<Feature-Question-List, `QuestionListCommand`>> - Listing questions
* `QuestionSlideshowCommand` - Starting a slideshow (See <<Feature-Slideshow, slideshow feature>>)

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

_To Add: Class diagram of the interaction between the question parser and commands_

[[Feature-Question-Add]]
==== Add command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `QuestionAddCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `QuestionAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates type of question defined.
The type defined will dictate if the resulting question will be a `OpenEndedQuestion` or `McqQuestion` question type.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#addQuestion(Question question)` will then be called to add the question and a success message will
be generated by the `QuestionAddCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Question question)` method and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Question-Edit]]
==== Edit command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `QuestionEditCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `QuestionEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Index` defined when
instantiating `QuestionEditCommand(Index index, HashMap<String, String> fields)` is valid.
Since it is optional for the users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing value currently defined in
the `Question` object.
[NOTE]
If the question type is changed from open ended to mcq, it is necessary for the user to defined all four options i.e a/ b/ c/ d/.

*Step 2*. A new `Question` with the updated values will be created and replace the existing question object
through the `Model#setQuestion(Index index, Question question)` method at the specified `Index` defined by the user.

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the `QuestionAddCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Question question)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Question-Delete]]
==== Delete command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `QuestionDeleteCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `QuestionDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Index` defined when
instantiating `QuestionDeleteCommand(Index index, HashMap<String, String> fields)` is valid.

*Step 2*. The `Question` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `QuestionBank#questions` observable list through
the `Model#deleteQuestion(Index index)` method.

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the `QuestionAddCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Question question)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Question-List]]
==== List command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `QuestionListCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `QuestionListCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed. No validation is necessary here since it
does not write to the question list.

*Step 2*. The `Model#getQuestionsSummary()` method is then called and the questions are returned as a `String` to the new `CommandResult`
object.

==== Design Considerations

===== Command Syntax
* ** Current Implementation: **
** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax e.g question followed by the arguments necessary
to execute the add, edit, delete, list and slideshow command.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Usage of a forward slash `/` and then the command word. Although it makes it clearer that the input is a command, we
realised it is redundant as the only input will be commands and will make it more tedious for the user.

===== Command Length

* ** Current Implementation: **
** Commands are currently shortened as much as possible through the use of initials without much loss in clarity.
For example, instead of using optionA/ to denote the first option, we use a/ instead. Although this may be unfamiliar
to the user initially, it should be easy to pick up and will make it less tedious during input.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Using more descriptive terms as arguments such that each argument will be specified clearly. However, this decreases
the user experience as the command will be too long.

[[Feature-Slideshow]]
=== Slideshow feature

The slideshow feature is dependent on the questions added by the `question slideshow [question no(s).]` command and
interacts with the `ModelManager` to retrieve the list of questions to be displayed in the slideshow.
The logic control for displaying the ui resides in the `SlideshowWindow` class and handles the controls and instantiation
of the various `QuestionPanel` that contains each question. +

Below is the sequence diagram of the interactions that happen from when the slideshow command is entered, to the corresponding
questions displayed in the slideshow.

image::SlideshowFeatureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following is an example and detailed explanation as to how the questions are fetched and displayed on the slideshow. +

*Step 1.* The user requests to start a slideshow with a selection of questions using the `question slideshow [question no(s).]` command.
This will add questions based on the `Index` specified and will be added to the `slideshowQuestions` list under the `SavedQuestions` class.
The usage of `Index` here is such that it follows the same convention of when the user edits or deletes a question.
[NOTE]
The order of the questions displayed on the slideshow will be *based on the input order*.

*Step 2.* The command is executed and the `MainWindow` calls `CommandResult#isShowSlideshow()` to verify if the command specified
is to start a slideshow. The `SlideshowWindow` is then displayed through the `SlideshowWindow#slideShowWindow.show()`.
[NOTE]
The slideshow window has already been instantiated on application launch and the window is merely being hidden or shown.

*Step 3.* The window is now visible and existing questions are cleared. The list of slideshow questions is then fetched through
`Logic#getSlideshowQuestions()` which in turn calls the `ModelManager#getSlideshowQuestions()` that fetches
the `slideshowQuestions` list in `SavedQuestions`.

*Step 4.* The user will then navigate and control the slideshow using the `Left/Right`, `Space` and `Esc` key as defined by the key
listeners in `SlideshowWindow#initialiseKeyboardControls(Stage root)`.

*Step 5.* The user exits the slideshow when the `Esc` key event is triggered or when the `currQuestionIndex` exceeds the `questionPanels.size()` or
it falls below `0`. The behaviour of this follows the common procedure that most presentation programs adopt thus, it will not
feel foreign to users.

image::SlideshowFeatureActivityDiagram.png[]
_Activity diagram of the actions performed_

==== Design Considerations

===== Controls

* ** Current Implementation: **
** The choice of using the arrow keys for navigation and the `Escape` key to quit the slideshow is such that it will feel
familiar to users who uses presentation programs often as they have similar controls. The only difference will be the usage
of the `Space` key to show answers as it will be something new to the users and is unique to Njoy.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Usage of the `A` key to show answers. However, this is not very feasible as it is easily forgotten and not as user-friendly
due to the smaller surface of the key as compared to the `Space` key.

===== Display

* ** Current Implementation: **
** The ordering of the questions is defined based on the user input so it gives flexibility to the user to choose the ordering
that they want the questions to be displayed.
** Placement of the question numbering, topic, options and answer follows the common convention where
the question numbering will be at the top followed by the topic, options and then the answer. This is such that viewers
will not be confused by the layout.
** *Font sizes* are displayed in the following descending order to allow the text for easy viewing:
*** [.big]##Question Number##
*** Question Topic & Options
*** [.small]#Answer#

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Having a separate answer format for MCQ such that it will have an arrow beside the correct option _e.g A) 1965_ *< (Answer)*.
However, this is not feasible as it will break the standard formatting of the answers display since both *Open Ended* and *MCQ*
questions will have 2 different answer formats and may cause confusion to the user.

=== Quiz feature

[.big]##**Overview**##

The quiz feature utilises the questions implemented and stored in the `QuestionBank#questions` observable list. The quiz feature utilises the `QuizCommandParser` class to parse the user command input into the different command types and validates the input. Quizzes are then added into the `QuizBank#quizzes` observable list. The quiz feature also relies heavily on the `QuizManager` class for handling commands from `QuizCommand#execute`. This is done to hide the implementation logic from the `ModelManager` class. +

The feature comprises of eight commands namely,

* <<Feature-Quiz-Create-Manually, `QuizCreateManuallyCommand`>> - Creates a quiz with user input manually
* <<Feature-Quiz-Create-Automatically, `QuizCreateAutomaticallyCommand`>> - Creates a quiz automatically
* <<Feature-Quiz-Add-Question, `QuizAddQuestionCommand`>> - Adds an existing question to an existing quiz
* <<Feature-Quiz-Delete-Question, `QuizDeleteQuestionCommand`>> - Deletes an existing question from an existing quiz
* <<Feature-Quiz-Export, `QuizExportCommand`>> - Exports an existing quiz to a html file
* <<Feature-Quiz-List, `QuizListCommand`>> - Listing questions and answers of an existing quiz
* <<Feature-Quiz-ShowAnswers, `QuizShowAnswersCommand`>> - Showing answers of an existing quiz
* <<Feature-Quiz-ShowQuestions, `QuizShowQuestionsCommand`>> - Showing questions of an existing quiz

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

The quiz creation processes share similar paths and is further illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

.Sequence Diagram for `quiz manual` and `quiz auto` Commands
image::QuizCreateDiagram.png[]

The other processes share similar paths and is further illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

* <<Feature-Student-Add, `StudentAddCommand`>> - Adding students to overall student list
* <<Feature-Student-Edit, `StudentEditCommand`>> - Editing students
* <<Feature-Student-Delete, `StudentDeleteCommand`>> - Deleting students
* <<Feature-Student-List, `StudentListCommand`>> - Listing students

_To Add: Class diagram of the interaction between the student parser and commands_

[[Feature-Student-Add]]
==== Add command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `StudentAddCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `StudentAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the student defined.
Since student names are unique, if a duplicate student is input, and exception is thrown and the duplicate student is not added.

*Step 2* If tags are present in the input, `Tags` are created and added to the `Student` in the
`StudentCommandParser#addCommand(ArgumentMultimap argMultimap)` method.

*Step 3*. The method `Model#addStudent(Student student)` will then be called to add the created student and a success message will
be generated by the `StudentAddCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Student student)` method and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Student-Edit]]
==== Edit command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `StudentEditCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `StudentEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Index` defined when
instantiating `StudentEditCommand(Index index, EditStudentDescriptor editStudentDescriptor)` is valid. It uses the
`StudentEditCommand.EditStudentDescriptor` to create the new student.

*Step 2*. A new `Student` with the updated values will be created and replace the existing student object
through the `Model#setStudent(studentToEdit, editedStudent)` method.

*Step 3* The filtered student list will be updated with the new student with the
`model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` method.

*Step 4*. A success message will be generated by the
`StudentEditCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Student studentToEdit, Student editedStudent)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Student-Delete]]
==== Delete command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `StudentDeleteCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `StudentDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it checks if the `Index` defined when
instantiating `StudentDeleteCommand(Index index)` is valid (IE: Not out of bounds of student list)

*Step 2*. The `Student` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list through
the `Model#deleteStudent(Index index)` method.

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the `StudentDeleteCommand#generateSuccessMessage(Student student)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Student-List]]
==== List command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `StudentListCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `StudentListCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed. No validation is necessary here since it
does not write to the student list.

*Step 2*. The `Model#getStudentSummary()` method is then called and the questions are returned as a `String` to the new `CommandResult`
object.

*Step 3*. If any view other than the view of the student list is showing on the `MainWindow`, the 'MainWindow#handleStudent() method
is called and the student list is now visible on the Main Window.
[NOTE]
In this implementation of the application, the list of students is rendered on the GUI of the main window. Hence, the command merely prints its contents on the Command Result box.

===== Design Considerations

===== Command Syntax
* ** Current Implementation: **
** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax e.g student followed by the arguments necessary
to execute the add, edit, delete, list and slideshow command.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Usage of a forward slash `/` and then the command word. Although it makes it clearer that the input is a command, we
realised it is redundant as the only input will be commands and will make it more tedious for the user.

===== Command Length

* ** Current Implementation: **
** Commands are currently shortened as much as possible through the use of initials without much loss in clarity.
For example, when denoting the index number of the student to delete in `StudentDeleteCommand`, we use index/ instead
of studentIndexNumber/.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Using more descriptive terms as arguments such that each argument will be specified clearly. However, this decreases
the user experience as the command will be too long.

=== Tag feature
The tag command was included in nJoyAssistant to help teachers identify the weak subjects of
their students easily.
The tag feature utilises the `TagCommandParser` class to parse and validate the
user input. Tags are then added into the `Student` that was specified by the `Index`
in the input.

The feature comprises of one command namely,

* <<Feature-Tag, `TagCommand`>> - Tagging student specified by index number

The command when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

_To Add: Class diagram of the interaction between the tag parser and command_

[[Feature-Tag]]
==== Tag command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `TagCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `TagCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the tag(s) defined.
Since tags attached to a 'Student' are unique, if duplicate tags are added to a 'Student', an error message
is shown.

NOTE: If more than one tag is to be added, do tag/TAG_ONE tag/TAG_TWO. Full example:
"tag index/1 tag/Chemistry tag/Physics"

*Step 2*. The method `TagCommand#createTaggedStudent(Student studentToTag,Set<Tag> tagSet)` will then be called
to create a new student with the updated tags, and the method `model#setStudentWithIndex(Index actualIndex, Student updatedStudent)` will
update the existing student with the new student(with the tags)

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the
`TagCommand#generateSuccessMessage(String taggedStudentNotification, String existedTagsNotification)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

===== Design Considerations

===== Command Syntax
* ** Current Implementation: **
** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax e.g tag followed by the arguments necessary
to execute the tag command.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Usage of a forward slash `/` and then the command word. Although it makes it clearer that the input is a command, we
realised it is redundant as the only input will be commands and will make it more tedious for the user.

===== Command Clarity
* ** Current Implementation: **
** "tag index/1 tag/Chemistry tag/Physics"
** We currently have a tag/ before each tag that is to be added to the student at the specified index number. Although
this might be slightly lengthier, it is clearer that we are adding two separate tags as opposed to one tag with a space in
between.


* ** Alternatives Considered: **
**  "tag index/1 tag/Chemistry Physics"
** Using just one tag/ before inserting all the tags to be added to the particular student may result in a wrong tag with more
than one word being added.

=== Mark feature
The mark feature is included in nJoyAssistant to help teachers identify the students who are in dire need of
academic help due to poor overall results.
The tag feature utilises the `MarkCommandParser` class to parse and validate the
user input.

The feature comprises of two commands namely,

* <<Feature-Mark-Add, `AddMarkCommand`>> - Marking student specified by index number
* <<Feature-Mark-Remove, `RemoveMarkCommand`>> - Unmarking student specified by index number

The command when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

_To Add: Class diagram of the interaction between the tag parser and command_

[[Feature-Mark-Add]]
==== Add Mark command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `AddMarkCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `AddMarkCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the `Index` derived from the input.

NOTE: Index cannot be out of bounds of the student list, and cannot attempt to mark a student that has already been marked.

*Step 2*. The method `Student#setMarked()` will then be called to mark the `Student` with the specified `Index`

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the
`AddMarkCommand#generateSuccessMessage(String MESSAGE_SUCCESS, int index)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Mark-Remove]]
==== Remove Mark command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `RemoveMarkCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `RemoveMarkCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the `Index` derived from the input.

NOTE: Index cannot be out of bounds of the student list, and cannot attempt to unmark a student that has not already been marked.

*Step 2*. The method `Student#setUnmarked()` will then be called to mark the `Student` with the specified `Index`

*Step 3*. A success message will be generated by the
`RemoveMarkCommand#generateSuccessMessage(String MESSAGE_SUCCESS, int index)` method
and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.
==== Design Considerations

realised it is redundant as the only input will be commands and will make it more tedious for the user.


=== Group feature

The group feature utilises the students stored in the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list.
The group feature utilises the `GroupCommandParser` class to parse the user command input into the different command types and validates the input.

The feature comprises of four commands namely,

* <<Feature-Group-Create-Manually, `GroupCreateManuallyCommand`>> - Creates a group with user input manually
* <<Feature-Group-Add-Student, `GroupAddStudentCommand`>> - Adds a student to an existing group
* <<Feature-Group-Remove-Student, `GroupRemoveStudentCommand`>> - Removes a student from an existing group
* <<Feature-Group-List, `GroupGetStudentsCommand`>> - Listing students of an existing group

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

[[Feature-Group-Create-Manually]]
==== Create Manually command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `GroupCreateManuallyCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `GroupCreateManuallyCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the groupId, making sure that there is no existing group with the same groupId. Then, it validates the student numbers, making sure that all student numbers currently exist within the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#createGroupManually(String groupId, ArrayList<Integer> studentNumbers)` will then be called to create the group with the specified students.

*Step 3*. Then, a success message will be generated by the `GroupCreateManuallyCommand#generateSuccessMessage()` method and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Group-Add-Student]]
==== Add Student command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `GroupAddStudentCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `GroupAddStudentCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates the student number, making sure that the student number currently exists within the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#addStudentToGroup(String groupId, int studentNumber, int groupIndexNumber)` will then be called to add the specified student to the specified group, with the specified group index number.

*Step 3*. Then, a success message will be generated by the `GroupAddStudentCommand#generateSuccessMessage()` method and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Group-Remove-Student]]
==== Remove Student command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `GroupRemoveStudentCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `GroupRemoveStudentCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#removeStudentFromGroup(String groupId, int studentNumber)` will then be called to remove a specified student from the specified group.

*Step 3*. Then, a success message will be generated by the `GroupRemoveStudentCommand#generateSuccessMessage()` method and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[[Feature-Group-List]]
==== List(Show) command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `GroupGetStudentsCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `GroupGetStudentsCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed.

*Step 2*. The method `ListOfGroups#setCurrentlyQueriedGroup(String groupId)` will then be called to set the currently queried group to match the one that the user input, and `CommandResultType` is set to `SHOW_GROUP`

*Step 3*. The method `MainWindow#handleGroup()` is then called, opening a new window to show the queried group and the relevant students.

*Step 3*. Then, a success message will be generated by the `GroupGetStudents#generateSuccessMessage()` method and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message.

[NOTE]
In this implementation of the application, the groups and respective students are rendered on the GUI of the new window. Hence, the command merely prints its contents on the Command Result box.

==== Design Considerations

===== Command Syntax
* ** Current Implementation: **
** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax e.g group followed by the minimum arguments necessary
to execute the tag command.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Usage of a forward slash `/` and then the command word. Although it makes it clearer that the input is a command, we
realised it is redundant as the only input will be commands and will make it more tedious for the user.

===== Aspect: Command Length

* ** Current Implementation: **
** Commands are currently shortened as much as possible without much loss in clarity.
For example, instead of using showStudentsInGroup/ , we just ask users to provide groupId/[GROUP_ID] to show a list of students in that group.
Although this may be unfamiliar to the user initially, it should be easy to pick up and will make it less tedious during input.

* ** Alternatives Considered: **
** Using more descriptive terms as arguments such that each argument will be specified clearly. However, this decreases
the user experience as the command will be too long.

[[Feature-Notes]]
=== Notes feature

The notes feature acts as a lightweight,digital “Post-It” for teachers.

The feature comprises of four commands namely,

* <<Feature-Note-Add, `NoteAddCommand`>> - Creates a note with a description.
* <<Feature-Note-Edit, `NoteEditCommand`>> - Edits an existing note.
* <<Feature-Note-Delete, `NoteDeleteCommand`>> - Deletes an existing note.
* <<Feature-Note-List, `NoteListCommand`>> -Lists all notes.

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).
[[Feature-Note-Add]]
==== Add Note Command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `NoteAddCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `NoteAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates that the `Note` object passed from the parser using command input is valid.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#addNote(Note note)` will then be called to add the specified note to the `NotesRecord`. The `Note` added is validated for uniqueness by `Note#isSameNote(Note note)`.

[NOTE]
The `ReadOnlyNotesRecord` hides the implementation of the NotesRecord from the other layers of the software.

*Step 3*. If successful, a success message will be generated and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message. Otherwise, an error message showing proper note command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

*Step 4*. If the command syntax was valid and `Note` was added to the `NotesRecord`, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveNotesRecord(ReadOnlyNotesRecord notesRecord)` which saves the `NotesRecord` in JSON format after serializing it using the `JsonSerializableNotesRecord`.

The following is a sample sequence diagram of the `NoteAddCommand`. Other commands under the notes feature follow a similar program flow; their diagrams have been omitted for brevity.

.Sequence Diagram for Adding Notes

.Supplementary Frame for Sequence Diagram
image::DeveloperGuideResources/NoteAddFrame.png[]

[[Feature-Note-Edit]]
==== Edit Note Command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `NoteEditCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `NoteEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates that the `Note` index is within range. It uses the `NoteEditCommand.EditNoteDescriptor` to create the new note.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#setNote(Note noteToEdit, Note editedNote)` will then be called to edit the note from the `NotesRecord`. The method `NotesRecord#setNote(Note target, Note editedNote)` validates that the edited note maintains the unique property of each note in its internal list using the comparison `Note#isSameNote(Note note)`. If it is unique, the target note is edited to the new one.

*Step 3*. If successful, a success message will be generated by the and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message. Otherwise, an error message showing proper note command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

*Step 4*. If the command syntax was valid and `Note` was edited from the `NotesRecord`, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveNotesRecord(ReadOnlyNotesRecord notesRecord)` which saves the edited notes in JSON format after serializing it using the `JsonSerializableNotesRecord`.

[[Feature-Note-Delete]]
==== Delete note command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `NoteDeleteCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `NoteDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and it validates that the specified `Note` index to delete is within range. If valid, the note is retrieved using its index in the `Model`’s filtered notes list.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#deleteNote(Note noteToDelete)` will then be called to remove the note from the `NotesRecord`. `NotesRecord#removeNote(Note note)` is invoked which makes a call to its internal list to remove the speficied note.

[NOTE]
Unlike the previous `Note` comparisons, removal of notes from the internal list uses `Note#equals(Object other)` comparison instead of the `Note#isSameNote(Note otherNote)`.

*Step 3*. If successful, a success message will be generated by the and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message. Otherwise, an error message showing proper note command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

*Step 4*. If the command syntax was valid and `Note` was removed from the `NotesRecord`, `LogicManager` calls `Storage#saveNotesRecord(ReadOnlyNotesRecord notesRecord)` which saves the new notes record in JSON format after serializing it using the `JsonSerializableNotesRecord`.

[[Feature-Note-List]]
==== Note list command

[NOTE]
In this implementation of the application, the teacher’s notes are rendered on the GUI on loading the application. Hence, the list notes command merely prints its contents on the Command Result box.

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `NoteListCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `NoteListCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed. It updates the notes list in `Model`. It retrieves the `NotesRecord` object of type `ReadOnlyNotesRecord` in the `ModelManager` to enumerate the list.

*Step 2*. The method `NoteListCommand#generateSuccessMessage(ReadOnlyNotesRecord notesRecord)` generates a String representation of the notes in the command.

*Step 3*. If successful, a success message will be generated by the and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the generated success message. Otherwise, an error message showing proper note command syntax is thrown as `CommandException`.

*Step 4*. Success message enumerating the notes in the notes record is rendered in the command result box.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Command Length

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Short, intuitive and minimal compulsory fields.
** Pros: More flexible for the user, easier to use and very lightweight.
** Cons: Not as powerful and less utility for advanced users.
* **Alternative 2:** Many fields including tagging, redo, undo et cetera.
** Pros: Powerful, many features that advanced users can use.
** Cons: Against original target of making the Notes feature super lightweight and easy to use. Should be as easy as a digital Post-it!

[NOTE]
Additional fields to the Note have been made optional such that it is very easy to use for beginner users and at the same time powerful for advanced ones. We
aim to keep our notes feature as simple as a pen-paper recording or even simpler.

[[Feature-Statistics]]
=== Statistics feature

The slideshow feature allows users of Njoy to generate statistics reports using external files as input data.

Current File Compatibilities: Excel(.xlsx)

A generic data parser of external files is used to generate HashMap of student’s data as specified by the input file. This processed data is passed to a Statistics Model which performs statistical analysis before passing back to the UI for rendering.

.Class Diagram for Statistics Feature
image::DeveloperGuideResources/StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]


The following is an example usage scenario where the Actor/User asks Njoy for a statistics report.

*Step 1*. Actor/User inputs a statistics command with data path as specified in user guide. `MainWindow#executeCommand(String commandText)` passes the user input to the `LogicManager`.

*Step 2*. The logic manager passes received input into its main parser which recognises this is a command for statistics. It passes the input to the `StatisticsCommandParser` for retrieving data from the external file. All data file parsers implements the `DataParser` interface.

*Step 3*. Suppose the data was successfully retrieved, `Statistics` object is generated for data processing and passed into `StatisticsAddCommand`.

*Step 4*. Execution of this command results in the processed data being passed to the `ModelManager` using `StatisticsAddCommand#execute`.

*Step 5*. The success result of the Statistics command is shown on the GUI and the execution call has returned no `MainWindow#executeCommand(String commandText)`. It
recognises the command was a valid Statistics command and opens window to show the processed data.

[NOTE]
If the input file is not formatted as specified in the user guide, a `ParseException` would be thrown to show error message as the result. No new window is opened. The diagram below illustrates possible program control flows.

.Activity Diagram for Statistics Feature
image::DeveloperGuideResources/StatisticsActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Rendering UI

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Opens a new window for the report generated.
** Pros: More space to work with, able to generate more comprehensive report that is easier to view.
** Cons: Data widgets are no longer stateful, they are newly created every time new report is requested.
* **Alternative 2:** Render data for current state of the model on the original application.
** Pros: Stateful, no need to recreate the widget every time there is new input data.
** Cons: Lack of space, hard to render other UI elements such as the timetable.

===== Aspect: [Proposed] Storing of generated data reports.
* ** [Proposed] Alternative 1 (preferred choice):** Generate a pdf report every time user requests for the report.
** Pros: Available for printing, portable.
** Cons: Can be difficult to implement, need good understanding of API.
* **Alternative 2:** Render a report from a stored library of reports when requested.
** Pros: Easy to use, no need to input long file path every time.
** Cons: User most likely have data stored in respective educational database system. Report generation is not computationally intensive and thus offers little performance advantage for effort.

=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Event Feature
==== Implementation

The Event feature is facilitated by the Event class and managed by the EventRecord class
The EventRecord class converts between an event object and VEvent object which is imported from the vCalendar jfxtras library. VEvent objects are the required type for rendering using the iCalendarAgenda object fromm the iCalendarAgenda jfxtras library.

The question feature utilises the `EventCommandParser` class to parse the user command input into the different
command types and validates the input.

The included functionalites for event management are:
* <<Feature-Event-Add, `EventAddCommand`>> - Adding events
* <<Feature-Event-Edit, `EventEditCommand`>> - Editing events
* <<Feature-Event-Delete, `EventDeleteCommand`>> - Deleting events

The included functionalites for event schedule panel management are:
* <<Feature-Calendar-Daily, `CalendarDailyCommand`>> - Switch to daily view
* <<Feature-Calendar-Weekly, `CalendarWeeklyCommand`>> - Switch to weekly view
* <<Feature-Calendar-Date, `CalendarDateCommand`>> - Show calendar range which includes date of user input

[[Feature-Event-Add]]
==== Add command

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations `EventAddCommand` performs. +

*Step 1*. The `EventAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed and creates a new VEvent based on the user input.
The user is allowed to create recurring events (daily, weekly, none) and also set the color of the VEvent by inputting a number
from 0-23. The datetime inputs follow the LocalDateTime format.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#addVEvent(VEvent vEvent)` will then be called to add the VEvent and a success message will
be generated by the `EventAddCommand#generateSuccessMessage(VEvent vEvent)` method and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the generated success message.

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic, logic component>> for the general overview).

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
