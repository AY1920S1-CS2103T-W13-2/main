[NOTE]
The statistics report is stored in the same place as where the JAR file is installed. The report can be found under a newly created `printable` directory. If the directory exists beforehand, no new directory is created.

[NOTE]
Filenames without _`.png`_ extension will automatically have the extension appended to the end of the file name.

[NOTE]
If the file name specified already exists in the printable directory, it will overwrite the existing file.

Examples:

[WARNING]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in either the excel file being rejected or erroneous statistics.

* *Data starts at cell A1.*
* *First row begins with the cell `Students`, followed by their names. (e.g. row 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Jason`, `Mike` and `Peter`)*
* *First column states the different subjects starting from the second topmost cell. (e.g column 1 of 4 cells having `Students`, `Math`, `Science` and `English`.)*
* *All student names have unique identifiers. (e.g. two students named Jason should be identified as `Jason 1` and `Jason 2`)*
* *All students have a corresponding score for all subjects*
* *All scores are numeric characters (integer or decimals)*

[WARNING]
Failure to adhere to the following specifications might result in some of the statistical data generated not being useful to the user.

* *All scores should be in percentage terms. (0 ~ 100)*

The statistics report generated uses weighted average scores across the different subjects to perform analysis. All scores carry equal weight. The statistics generated
allow you to see some of the common descriptive statistics and their relative distributions both in terms of frequency and percentile terms.

The figure below illustrates a sample data set that fulfills all of the above specifications.
