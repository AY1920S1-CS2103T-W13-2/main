== Introduction and Overview

The purpose of this document is to display the author's (Jeong Yu Han) contribution to the software engineering project and his technical skills.

My team and I were tasked with enhancing a command line interface application for our Software Engineering project.
We chose to morph it into a teaching assistant called the Njoy Teaching Assistant, targeted at tech-savvy teachers who wish to improve
the efficiency of their daily tasks such as creating quizzes, schedules and tracking student performances.

This is what our project looks like:

My role was to design and write code for the notes and statistics features. The rest of the sections covers the
summary of my contributions to the codebase, user guide and developer guide.

The following are icons and symbols that I will be using for the Project Portfolio:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates a note to the user.

`This indicates a component, class or object of Njoy or other external softwares.`

== Summary of contributions

This section details a summary of my specific enhancements, code contributions and other tasks.

I implemented the notes commands which include: *Creating*, *Editing*, *Deleting*, *Listing*, *Sorting* notes. +
Another feature I implemented was the ability to *generate and store Statistics reports*.

=== Enhancements

==== Creating, Editing and Deleting Notes

* *What it does:* Users can add notes with a title, description and an optional priority.
The default priority is unmarked and different priorities are color coded. The features can be edited/deleted by specifying their index and the fields to edit.

* *Justification:* Teachers often have a dizzying array of tasks to handle. The notes feature allows teachers to deal with work and other worries and allows them to handle the most pressing issues. Editing and deleting
gives the flexibility of shifting priorities, typing errors and task completion.

* *Highlights:* The implementation for this feature required contemplation in terms of UX. While additional features such as re/un-doing was considered, the main principle of the notes UX is to be
lightweight and easy to use. I decided to give the simplest set of commands while making prioritising optional. Validation for the input command
was also challenging, in particular for the edit command.

==== Sorting Notes

* *What it does:* Sorts the notes in the list in descending order of priority.

* *Justification:* Users should be easily able to identify more pressing tasks.

==== Listing Notes

* *What it does:* Shows the list of notes in the command result box. This feature is an alternative solution to the issue of notes having
content length that exceed its allocated space in the User Interface.

==== Generating and Storing Statistics

* *What it does:* Read student score data from excel file and process it to generate some descriptive statistics on performance. Store as optionally specified image file.

* *Justification:* Give teachers the ability to see class performance at a glance and identify weaker students to help.

* *Highlights:* The implementation for this feature required contemplation on the decision of storing and rendering formats for the report.
